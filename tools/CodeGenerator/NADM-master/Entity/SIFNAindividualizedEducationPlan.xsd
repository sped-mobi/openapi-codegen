				Information to support Special Education students transferring into a new educational context. Specifically, this model supports these use cases: Use Case 1 (Day Zero): An administrator is able to quickly look at the incoming information to decide where to place the student on the first day. Use Case 2 (Ongoing IEP): A committee on the receiving school quickly understands the needs and services of a student in a way that allows it to take the actions necessary for the student to have the best outcome. Use Case 3 (State Reporting): Data analysts at the receiving school build a complete student profile supporting their reporting and resource management needs.
